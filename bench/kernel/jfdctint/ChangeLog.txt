Original provenience: SNU-RT Benchmark Suite for Worst Case Timing Analysis

2016-02-01:
- Added generic TACLeBench header.
- Removed old file header (keep some information in TACLeBench header).
- Renamed global variable date to jfdctint_data.
- Renamed main to jfdctint_main.
- Moved initialisation code to jfdctint_init
- Implemented new main function according to TACLeBench guidlines.
- Implemented new function jfdctint_return, calculates checksum over
  all data.
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
    prefix (here: bs_) followed by lowercase letter (e.g., bs_square)
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace

  - Replaced INT32 with int.
  - Replaced DCTELEM with int.
- Removed macros:
  - GLOBAL (useless)
  - Unused "FIX_... FIX(..)" definitions (unused)
  - BITS_IN_JSAMPLE (used in #ifdef...#else..., keep only #if part)
  - SHIFT_TEMPS (empty)
  - JPEG_INTERNALS (unused)
  - MULTIPLY (simply multiply *)
  - ONE (used only once)
  - RIGHT_SHIFT (used only once)
