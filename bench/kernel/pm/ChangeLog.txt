2015-12-08:
- Replaced comments in line 1-37 with generic TACLeBench header.
- Introduced comments to split file in sections for type definition, forward
  declarations, global variables, initialization-related and 
  return-value-related functions, core benchmark functions, and main routine.
- Moved BSD 3-clause license comment to own file license.txt.
- Inlined contents of file input.c (i.e. definitions of lib_data and 
  pattern_data).
- Renamed global variables lib_data and pattern_data to pm_lib_data and 
  pm_pattern_data and made them static.
- Renamed functions read_lib and read_pattern to pm_init_lib and
  pm_init_pattern.
- Removed unnecessary return statements.
- Inlined definition of types PmData and PcaCArrayFloat from PcaCArray.h.
- Renamed type PmData to pm_data_t.
- Renamed type PcaCArrayFloat to pm_float_array_t.

- Renamed function begin to filterbank_main.
- Renamed function FBCore to filterbank_core.
- Renamed global variable numiters to filterbank_numiters and made it static.
- Added function filterbank_init that handles the initialization of global 
  variables.
- Added function filterbank_return that handles the original return value of main.
- Added new function main that first calls filterbank_init, then filterbank_main and
  finally returns the return value of filterbank_return.
- Added forward declarations for all these functions.
- Changed all //-style comments to /* */-style comments
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules:
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
  - Function arguments are specified in ANSI style, i.e.,
      float my_sqrtf( float val )
    and NOT in Kernighan&Ritchie style like, e.g.,
      float my_sqrtf( val )
        float val;
- Tested conformance to C90 via
  clang -fsyntax-only -Weverything -Wno-unknown-pragmas -pedantic -std=c90

2007-10-18 (Rathijit Sen, Universität des Saarlandes):
- Removed dynamic alloc, file I/O.
