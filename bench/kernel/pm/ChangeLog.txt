- Added forward declarations for all functions.
- Inlined contents of file input.c (i.e. definitions of lib_data and pattern_data).
- Renamed function main to pm_main.
- Renamed function init to pm_init_data.
- Renamed function clean to pm_clean.
- Changed all //-style comments to /* */-style comments
- Renamed function fabs_ to pm_fabs.
- Renamed function setcoeff to pm_init_coeff.
- Renamed pow10fpm to pm_pow10f.

- Renamed my_floor to pm_floor.
- Renamed my_ceil to pm_ceil.
- Renamed my_memcpy to pm_memcpy.

- Added new function main that first calls pm_init, then pm_main and finally returns the return value of pm_return.
- Replaced local variables pmdata, lib, patternand result in main with global static variables pm_data, pm_lib, pm_pattern and pm_result.
- Renamed global variables init_array_1, init_array_2, init_array_3, init_array_4, init_array_5, init_array_6, init_array_7 and init_array_8 to pm_init_array_1, pm_init_array_2, pm_init_array_3, pm_init_array_4, pm_init_array_5, pm_init_array_6, pm_init_array_7 and pm_init_array_8 and made them static.
- Renamed global variables pow_coeff and log_coeff to pm_pow_coeff and pm_log_coeff and made them static.
- Tested conformance to C90 via
  clang -fsyntax-only -Weverything -Wno-unknown-pragmas -pedantic -std=c90

  pm_pattern_data and made them static.
- Renamed functions read_lib and read_pattern to pm_init_lib and
  pm_init_pattern.
