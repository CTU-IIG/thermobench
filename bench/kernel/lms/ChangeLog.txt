Original provenience: C Algorithms for Real-Time DSP by Paul M. Embree, pp. 159,229-231

2016-06-16:
- The original source code from Paul M. Embree had several problems:
    * Source code was copied from a copyrighted book
    * Input generation used external math functions
    * Thus execution time of input generation dominated total execution time
    * Several arrays where uninitalised
    * Output printed to stdout but was not checked for correctness
    * lms() used static variables for internal state
