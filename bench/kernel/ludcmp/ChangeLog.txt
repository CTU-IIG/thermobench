Original provenience: SNU-RT benchmark suite, via MÃ¤lardalen benchmark

2015-11-27:
- Removed commented-out parameter nmax
- Made chkerr a global variable, set in the ludmp function
- Changed return value of ludcmp to void
- Renamed ludcmp to ludcmp_test, wrap call in new function ludcmp_main
- Move initialization code into new function ludcmp_init
- Compute checksum in new function ludcmp_return
- Prefix fabs and global variables with "ludcmp_"
- Reordered functions in source code: initialization- and
  return-value-related functions first, followed by algorithm core
  functions, followed by main functions
- Applied code formatting with astyle as in the example

2015-12-15:
- Sorted out licensing terms, added general TACLeBench header to
  beginning of source code
