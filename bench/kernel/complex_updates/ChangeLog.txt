Original provenience: DSP-Stone

2016-03-02:
- Rename n_complex_updates_float to n_complex_updates
- Add generic TACLeBench header
- Prefix global function with benchmark name
- Avoid accepting arbitrary number of parameters
- Introduce return statement
- Make A, B, C, D global variables
- Split code into n_complex_updates_init and n_complex_updates_main
2016-04-25:
- Rename to complex_updates in order to shorten prefixes
- Remove second call of pin_down, since this was originally used as a border for
  constant propagation
- Move pin_down call into init function
- Add operation on input data with volatile variable to completely prevent 
  constant propagation
- Prefix all global symbols with benchmark name
- Add calculation  of checksum on result data, which is used in return statement
- Apply code formatting with clang-format (manually move loop-bound annotation 
  into separate line and align assignments in complex_updates_main)
