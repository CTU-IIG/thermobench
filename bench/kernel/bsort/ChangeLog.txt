Original provenience: MÃ¤lardalen benchmark suite,

2016-04-20:
- Check upon call of bsort_return that bsort_Array is sorted.

2016-03-15:
- Renamed file from bsort100.c to bsort.c.
- Introduced comments to split file in sections for forward 
  declarations, global variables, initialization-related and 
  return-value-related functions, core benchmark functions, and 
  main routine.
- Added functions bsort_init and bsort_main that call 
  bsort_Initialize and bsort_BubbleSort, respectively.  
- Added function bsort_return that handles the return value.  
- Renamed function Initialize to bsort_Initialize.
- Renamed function BubbleSort to bsort_BubbleSort.
- Replaced preprocessor defines NUMELEMS and MAXDIM by unificated
  define bsort_SIZE, fixed bug that caused the first element of the
  array to be ignored during sorting.
- Replaced preprocessor defines TRUE, FALSE, WORSTCASE and
  KNOWN_VALUE by their values.
- Fixed compiler warning "unused variable 'Seed'" by removing the
  offending variable.
- Fixed compiler warning "no previous extern declaration for
  non-static variable" by making global variables static.
- Fixed compiler warning "unused variable 'LastIndex'" by removing 
  the offending variable.
- Fixed compiler warning "declaration shadows a variable in the
  global scope" by renaming global variable Array to bsort_Array.
- Fixed compiler warning "// comments are not allowed in this
  language" by removing dead code.
- Replaced comment describing purpose of benchmark with generic
  TACLeBench header.
- Applied TACLeBench formatting rules via
  astyle --options=doc/example/astylerc.txt
- Tested conformance to C90 via
  clang -fsyntax-only -Weverything -Wno-unknown-pragmas -pedantic -std=c90
