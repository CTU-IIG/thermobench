Original provenience: DSP-Stone benchmark suite, matrix1_fixed
  http://www.ice.rwth-aachen.de/research/tools-projects/entry/detail/dspstone

2016-02-09:
- Added TACLeBench header
- Redefined function pin_down() as returning void since the return value is
  insignificant
- Function pin_down() fills matrices A and B with 1s and matrix C with 0s.
  First call to it is kept as the initilization part, but the second call at
  the end of main function seems unnecessary, hence removed
- Added a new main function that first calls init function then the old main
  function sans init
- Redefined matrices A, B and C as global variables so that they are not local
  to new main function and can be initialized and processed with diferent
  functions
- Annotated matrix1_fixed_main() as the entry point of the analysis
- Removed unnecessary dereference operator from '*p_c++;' (line TODO:XXX) to
  remove compiler warning 'value computed not used'
- Removed seemingly unnecessary empty lines
- Moved around all the following so that they are in the given order just after
  the header
  - macro definitions
  - forward declaration of functions
  - declaration of global variables
  - initialization functions
  - main functions
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
  prefix (here: statemate_) followed by lowercase letter
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur

2016-04-26:
- Renamed benchmark: matrix1_fixed -> matrix1
- Changed prefix in function/variable names (matrix1_fixed -> matrix1)
- Removed macro definition (#define TYPE int)  and changed 'TYPE' into 'int'
- Removed macro definition (#define STORAGE_CLASS  register) and changed 'STORAGE_CLASS'
  into 'register'
- Declared initialisation value as volatile
- Added matrix1_return() function and call to this function from matrix1_main()

2016-10-08
- Added prefix to global matrix names: A -> matrix1_A, etc.
