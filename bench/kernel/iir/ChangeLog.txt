Original provenience: DSPstone benchmark suite (floating point),

2015-10-10:
- Removed original header comment, replaced by TACLeBench header.
- Removed all preprocessor macros, integrated them directly in the source code.
- Added prefix "iir" to all global symbols.
- Added explicit forward declarations of functions.
- Replaced local variables "wi", "coefficients" and "x" that store the
  benchmark's input data by global variables.
- Replaced initialization function iir_pin_down by TACLeBench-compliant
  initialization code.
- Removed second call of iir_pin_down from function iir_main since it does
  not make sense at all.
- Added new function iir_return producing a checksum as return value.
- Added new function iir_main according to TACLeBench guidelines.
  iir_main is annotated as entry-point for timing analysis.
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
    prefix (here: bs_) followed by lowercase letter (e.g., bs_square)
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
