Original provenience: SNU-RT Benchmark Suite for Worst Case Timing Analysis

2016-02-01:
- Added generic TACLeBench header.
- Removed old file header (keep some information in TACLeBench header).
- Made array arr global, renamed to select_arr.
- Introduced global variable select_selected, stores selected value.
- Implemented function select_init to initialise arr
- Implemented function select_return, returns selected value
- Renamed function select to select_select.
- Bugfixes in function select_select:
  - Adjust indices l, ir to C-style arrays.
  - Include curly braces in SWAP macro.
  - Reset flag2 before while loop.
- Renamed function main to select_main; stores return value of
  select_select in select_selected. Function set as entrypoint.
- Implemented new function main according to TACLeBench guidelines.
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
    prefix (here: bs_) followed by lowercase letter (e.g., bs_square)
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace

2016-02-03:
- Secured SWAP macro (keep the macro as it is used often).
- Corrected loop bounds.

2016-04-05:
- Return '0' on success
- Changed return type of select_return from float to int

2016-06-06:
- Fixed generation of return value
