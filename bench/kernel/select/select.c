  This program is part of the TACLeBench benchmark suite.
  Version V 2.0

  Name:

  Author: William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling,
          Brian P. Flannery, "Numerical Recipes in C"

  Function: A function to select the Nth largest number in the floating
            point array arr[].
            The parameters to function select are k and n. Then the function
            selects k-th largest number out of n original numbers.

	    The original algorithm was adjusted for inclusion in the
	    SNU-RT Benchmark Suite:

	    < Features > - restrictions for our experimental environment   
  
	    1. Completely structured.
	      - There are no unconditional jumps.
	      - There are no exit from loop bodies.
	      (There are no 'break' or 'return' in loop bodies)
	    2. No 'switch' statements.
	    3. No 'do..while' statements.
	    4. Expressions are restricted.
	      - There are no multiple expressions joined by 'or',
	      'and' operations.
	    5. No library calls.
	      - All the functions needed are implemented in the
	      source file.
