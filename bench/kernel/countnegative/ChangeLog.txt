File: countnegative.c
Original provenience: MÃ¤lardalen benchmark suite, www.mrtc.....

2015-11-26:
- Changed return type of InitSeed, Initialize, and Test to void
  because the result was ignored anyway
- Prefixed all functions and global variables with "countnegative_"
- Added new function countnegative_return computing a checksum as
  return value
- Separated initialization (called from countnegative_init) from
  actual computation (called from countnegative_main), remove
  pointless function countnegative_test afterwards
- Reordered functions in source code: initialization- and
  return-value-related functions first, followed by algorithm core
  function, followed by main functions
- Eliminated definition of macro WORSTCASE and kept only the relevant
  part of the related #ifdef block
- Removed comments that referred to MAXSIZE being 100 (instead of 20)
- Made countnegative_seed volatile
- Changed C++ style comments to C style comments
- Applied code formatting with astyle as in the example
- Added general TACLeBench header to beginning of source code

2016-03-15:
- Return 0 if checksum is as expected, -1 otherwise
- Add entrypoint pragma

2016-04-20:
- Cast "expected" return value to int for comparison
