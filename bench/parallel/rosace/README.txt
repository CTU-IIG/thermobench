Hand-written C POSIX implementation of the ROSACE Case Study from
 https://svn.onera.fr/schedmcore/branches/ROSACE_CaseStudy/c_posix_implementation/

The implementation is made of 5 threads assumed to be running at various
frequencies. The 5 original pthread threads were separated into distinct
sub-folders per thread here.
