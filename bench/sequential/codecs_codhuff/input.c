char *input = "You are doubtless asking \"How can I reduce the data size without losing some informations?\". It's easy to answer to this question. I'll only take an example. I'm sure you have heard about the morse. This system established in the 19th century use a scheme very close to the huffman one. In the morse you encode the letters to transmit with two kinds of signs. If you encode these two sign possibilities in one bit, the symbol 'e' is transmitted in a single bit and the symbols 'y' and 'z' need four bits. Look at the symbols in the text you are reading, you'll fast understand the compression ratio...";
