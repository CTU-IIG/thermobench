2016-06-22:
- Fixed type signature of function anagram_main to conform to TACLeBench
  standard, i.e. `void anagram_main (void)`.

2016-05-24:
- Changed type of global variables anagram_achPhrase and
  anagram_dictionary to `char const *[]`.
- Changed parameter type of function anagram_BuildMask to
  `char const *`.

2016-04-26:
- Fixed array out-of-bounds access introduced by earlier change.

2016-04-20:
- Fixed some compiler warnings.
- Return value of anagram_return depends on the computation inside
  of anagram_main.

2016-03-22
- Added forward declarations for all functions.
- Renamed function main to anagram_main.
- Added function anagram_init that calls anagram_ReadDict, removed
  call to anagram_ReadDict from anagram_main.
- Added function anagram_return that handles the return value.  
- Added new function main that first calls anagram_init, 
  then anagram_main and finally returns the return value of 
  anagram_return.
- Added generic TACLeBench header to all files.
- Introduced comments to split file in sections for type 
  definitions, forward declarations, global variables, 
  initialization-related and return-value-related functions, 
  core benchmark functions, and main routine.
- Renamed ch2i, DICTWORDS, Quad, MASK_BITS, MAX_QUADS, MAXCAND,
  MAXSOL, ALPHABET, Word, PWord, PPWord, apwCand, cpwCand, Letter,
  PLetter, alPhrase, cchPhraseLength, aqMainMask, aqMainSign,
  cchMinLength, auGlobalFrequency, achByFrequency, pchDictionary,
  Reset, ReadDict, BuildMask, NewWord, NextWord, BuildWord,
  AddWords, apwSol, cpwLast, OneStep, DumpWords, FindAnagram and
  SortCandidates to anagram_ch2i, anagram_DICTWORDS, anagram_Quad,
  anagram_MASK_BITS, anagram_MAX_QUADS, anagram_MAXCAND,
  anagram_MAXSOL, anagram_ALPHABET, anagram_Word, anagram_PWord,
  anagram_PPWord, anagram_apwCand, anagram_cpwCand, anagram_Letter,
  anagram_PLetter, anagram_alPhrase, anagram_cchPhraseLength,
  anagram_aqMainMask, anagram_aqMainSign, anagram_cchMinLength,
  anagram_auGlobalFrequency, anagram_achByFrequency,
  anagram_pchDictionary, anagram_Reset, anagram_ReadDict,
  anagram_BuildMask, anagram_NewWord, anagram_NextWord,
  anagram_BuildWord, anagram_AddWords, anagram_apwSol,
  anagram_cpwLast, anagram_OneStep, anagram_DumpWords,
  anagram_FindAnagram and anagram_SortCandidates.
- Renamed swapi, pivot, qsorts, simulated_heap and freeHeapPos to
  anagram_swapi, anagram_pivot, anagram_qsorts,
  anagram_simulated_heap and anagram_freeHeapPos.
- Renamed achPhrase and dictionary to anagram_achPhrase and
  anagram_dictionary.
- Renamed CompareFrequency to anagram_CompareFrequency.
- Increased simulated heap in anagram_stdlib.c to 18000 bytes to
  prevent segmentation fault.
- Changed header guard _WCCMALLOC_H to ANAGRAM_STRINGS_H.
- Renamed wccmalloc, wccbzero to anagram_malloc, anagram_bzero.
- Moved declaration of anagram_malloc to header anagram_stdlib.h.
- Introduced header guard ANAGRAM_CTYPE_H.
- Renamed wccislower, wccisupper, wccisalpha,  wcctolower to
  anagram_islower, anagram_isupper, anagram_isalpha, 
  anagram_tolower.
- Removed illegal keyword "inline".
- Changed header guard _WCCSTDLIB_H to ANAGRAM_STDLIB_H.
- Renamed wccqsort to anagram_qsort.
- Fixed compiler warning "no previous extern declaration for
  non-static variable" for variables simulated_heap and
  freeHeapPos by declaring them static.
- Renamed preprocessor define HEAP_SIZE to ANAGRAM_HEAP_SIZE.
- Fixed compiler warning "no previous prototype for function" by
  moving includes to the top of the file.
- Fixed compiler warnings "implicit conversion changes signedness" 
  and "comparison of integers of different signs" by consistenly
  using the type unsigned long in qsort helper functions.
- Moved function CompareFrequency to file anagram.c, added
  declaration for it in file anagram_compare.h and included it in
  anagram_stdlib.h.
- Fixed compiler warning "no previous extern declaration for 
  non-static variable" by adding forward declarations.
- Fixed compiler warning "macro is not used" by removing unused
  macros MAXWORDS and i2ch.
- Replaced macro ch2i by proper function.
- Fixed compiler warning "array subscript is of type 'char' in
  function CompareFrequency.
- Fixed compiler warning "unused variable" by removing variable i
  in function Reset.
- Fixed compiler warning "no previous extern declaration for 
  non-static variable" by making global variables in file 
  anagram.c static.
- Replaced macro lPhrase by its expansion.
- Fixed compiler warnings "implicit conversion loses integer 
  precision" and "implicit conversion changes signedness" by
  adding explicit casts or using the appropriate type for local
  variables.
- Fixed compiler warning "array subscript is of type 'char'" by
  changing type of some local variables as well as of global
  variable achByFrequency to int.
- Changed all //-style comments to /* */-style comments.
- Moved contents of wccmalloc.c to anagram_stdlib.c.
- Renamed input.c to anagram_input.c.

- Applied TACLeBench formatting rules via
  astyle --options=doc/example/astylerc.txt
- Tested conformance to C99 via
  clang -fsyntax-only -Weverything -Wno-unknown-pragmas -Wno-padded -pedantic -std=c99
