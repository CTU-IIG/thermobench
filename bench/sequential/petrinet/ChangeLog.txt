Original provenience: MÃ¤lardalen benchmark suite,
http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/projects/wcet/wcet_bench/nsichneu/nsichneu.c

2016-02-02:
- Added generic TACLeBench header.
- Removed old file header (keep some information in TACLeBench
  header).
- Renamed global variables:
  - main_iters_dummy_i -> petrinet_main_iters_dummy_i
  - main_min_dummy_i -> petrinet_main_min_dummy_i
  - main_max_dummy_i -> petrinet_main_max_dummy_i
  - P1_is_marked        -> petrinet_P1_is_marked	    
  - P1_marking_member_0 -> petrinet_P1_marking_member_0
  - P2_is_marked        -> petrinet_P2_is_marked	    
  - P2_marking_member_0 -> petrinet_P2_marking_member_0
  - P3_is_marked        -> petrinet_P3_is_marked	    
  - P3_marking_member_0 -> petrinet_P3_marking_member_0
- Renamed main function to petrinet_main, set as entrypoint.
- Implemented new function main according to TACLeBench guidelines.
- Implemented function petrinet_return, calculates checksum over
  petrinet_P3_marking_member_0.
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
    prefix (here: bs_) followed by lowercase letter (e.g., bs_square)
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
