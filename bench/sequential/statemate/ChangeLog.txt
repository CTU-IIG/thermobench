Original provenience: MÃ¤lardalen benchmark suite,
                      http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/projects/wcet/benchmarks.html

2016-02-02:
- Removed original header comment, replaced by TACLeBench header.
- Removed macro '#define float int' and replaced each 'float' by 'int' (8 in
  total)
- Removed unused macro
  - #define entered_EINSCHALTSTROM_MESSEN_BLOCK_ERKENNUNG_CTRL_copy_IDX 1
- Removed unused variables
  - int FH_TUERMODUL_CTRL__N_copy;
  - int BLOCK_ERKENNUNG_CTRL__I_EIN_MAX_copy;
  - int BLOCK_ERKENNUNG_CTRL__N_copy;
  - char FH_TUERMODUL_CTRL__FT;
  - char FH_TUERMODUL__COM_OPEN;
  - char FH_TUERMODUL__COM_CLOSE;
  - char FH_DU__S_FH_TMBFAUFCAN_copy;
  - char FH_DU__S_FH_TMBFZUCAN_copy;
- Moved around all the following so that they are in the given order just after
the header
  - macro definitions
  - forward declarations of fuctions
  - declarations of global variables
- Reordered functions in source code: initialization-related functions first,
  followed by algorithm core functions, followed by main functions
- Added a new main function that first calls init function then the old main
  function sans init
- Annotated statemate_main() as the entry point of the analysis
- Removed seemingly unnecessary empty lines
- Changed remaining floating number literals, all being used for time related
  comparisons, to integer literals by multiplying them by 1000 so that the
  code is totally floating number free. E.g:
  changed 'time - sc_FH_TUERMODUL_CTRL_2375_2 >= 0.5f'
       to 'time - sc_FH_TUERMODUL_CTRL_2375_2 >= 500'
  Info: All time related variables were already converted to 'unsigned long'
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
  prefix (here: statemate_) followed by lowercase letter
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur

  2016-10-10:
  - added statemate_return() function
