2016-02-26:
- Remove commented-out code
- Prefix functions with "rijndael_enc"
- Compute a checksum and return it from main
- Change return type of rijndael_enc_encfile to void
- Move functionality from function main into functions
  rijndael_enc_init, rijndael_enc_main, and rijndael_enc_return
- Reordered functions in source code: initialization- and
  return-value-related functions first, followed by algorithm core
  functions, followed by main functions
- Added function prototypes
- Applied code formatting with astyle as in the example
- Added general TACLeBench header to beginning of source code
- Rename to rijndael_enc.c

2016-03-15:
- Return 0 if checksum is as expected, -1 otherwise
- Add entrypoint pragma
- Make inputs volatile (or touch them with a volatile) to rule out
  optimizations

2016-04-20:
- Cast "expected" return value to int for comparison
- Make loop counter in rijndael_enc_init unsigned
