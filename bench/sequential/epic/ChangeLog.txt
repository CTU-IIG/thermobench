Original provenience: MediaBench benchmark suite,
                      http://euler.slu.edu/~fritts/mediabench/mb1/index.html

2016-02-03:
- Added TACLeBench header, also kept original copyright notice
- Removed commented-out code
- Removed seemingly unnecessary empty lines
- Removed unused function, variable, macro and type declarations except where
  they may help understanding the program.
- Slightly changed wording of original comments to keep them in line with the
  modified/removed code parts.
- Separated epic.c to epic.c and epic.h
- Added proper '#ifndef __EPIC_DATA_H_' and friends to epic_data.h
- Moved around all the following so that they are in the given order just after
the header
  - macro definitions
  - forward declaration of functions
  - declaration of global variables
- Added a new main function that first calls init function then the old main
  function sans init
- Annotated epic_main() as the entry point of the analysis
- Applied code formatting according to the following rules
  - Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
    line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
  - Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
    two whitespaces
  - Two empty lines are put between any two functions
  - In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
    one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
  - In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
    each comma/colon
  - Names of functions and global variables all start with a benchmark-specific
  prefix (here: epic_) followed by lowercase letter
  - For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
  - Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
    whitespace
  - Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
    separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
    "else"
  - Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
    body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
    "else", "for", "while" etc. occur

2016-10-10:
- removed unused parameter 'char *edges' in epic_internal_filter()
- included input data definition in epic.c, and removed epic_data.c and epic_data.h

2016-10-12:
- added initial value to variable 'rt_edge_res_pos' (in case the first for loop
at line 775) is not executed)
- added initial value to variable 'first_col' (in case the first for loop
at line 775) is not executed)

2016-10_14:
