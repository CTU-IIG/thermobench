\subsection{DSPstone\_fixed\_point/adpcm\_g721\_board\_test}

ADPCM 721 encoding and decoding of 32 samples. \\
REMOVE: Duplication. Not so nice license. \\
TODO: maybe there is some work to do.

\subsection{DSPstone\_fixed\_point/adpcm\_g721\_verify}

Basically the same as the above, just verifying the results. \\
REMOVE: Duplication of g712\_board\_test.

\subsection{MISC/codecs\_codhuff}

Huffman encoding. \\
KEEP: Different form all ADPCM code. \\
TODO: Merge with dcodhuff.

\subsection{MISC/codecs\_codrle1}

REMOVE: Too tiny. Maybe keep in kernel.

\subsection{MISC/codecs\_dcodhuff}

Huffman encoding. \\
KEEP: if merged with Huffman encoding. \\
TODO: merge with encoding to call encoding and decoding on the data.

\subsection{MISC/codecs\_dcodrle1}

REMOVE: too tiny. If kept as kernel, merge with codrle1.

\subsection{MISC/g721\_encode}

ADOCM 721 encoding, similar to above. But nicer license. \\
KEEP: maybe.

\subsection{MISC/g723\_encode}

REMOVE: Basically the same source as g721\_encode.

\subsection{MRTC/adpcm\_decoder}

ADPCM 722 decoding of 2 samples. Similar functionality as 
DSPstone, but different algorithms. \\
KEEP: keep, but adapt: larger sample size and merge with encoder.

\subsection{MRTC/adpcm\_encoder}

ADPCM 722 encoding of 2 samples. Similar functionality as 
DSPstone, but different algorithms. \\
KEEP: keep, but adapt: larger sample size and merge with decoder.

\subsection{MRTC/compressdata}

REMOVE: too small benchmark. Maybe keep in a kernels category.

\subsection{MRTC/crc}

REMOVE: too small benchmark. Maybe keep in a kernels category.

\subsection{MRTC/ndes}

Encryption, but not clear what it exactly does and where it comes from.
KEEP: but better be in a kernel category. \\
TODO: need to be checked agains other encryption benchmarks.

\subsection{MediaBench/gsm}

GSM encoding and decoding. \\
KEEP:
\subsection{MediaBench/gsm\_decode}

GSM decode. \\
REMOVE: included in gsm.

\subsection{MediaBench/gsm\_encode}

GSM encode. \\
REMOVE: included in gsm.

\subsection{MiBench/rijndael\_decoder}

AES decoder. \\
KEEP: merge with encoder. Need to be checked against other en/decryption code.

\subsection{MiBench/rijndael\_encoder}

AES encoder. \\
KEEP: merge with decoder. Need to be checked against other en/decryption code.

\subsection{MiBench/sha}

REMOVE: another crypto code, small code. Maybe keep in kernel category.

\subsection{NetBench/md5}

REMOVE: another small kernel. Maybe keep in kernel category.

\subsection{StreamIt/audiobeam}

KEEP: Looks interesting and different from the others.
TODO: Find a description and the original source.

\subsection{StreamIt/fmref}

KEEP: Looks interesting and different from the others. Maybe this belongs to kernel category.
TODO: Find a description and the original source.
