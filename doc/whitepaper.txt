Next step: document selection of benchmarks and why


Open issues:

There is an issue with size_t definition in a benchmark (e.g., bitcnt).
Definition of size_t (and similar) may give trouble when including
other include files. We do not want library definitions in benchmarks.
However, I think it would be cleaner to include stddef.h instead
of defining size_t in a benchmark. That should be ok for all C compiler.
