\begin{abstract}
We need benchmarks that fit the WCET and embedded community needs,
 \end{abstract}

\section{Notes}

\todo{Just internal notes to collect bullet points on ideas.}

\begin{itemize}
\item On issue with original benchmarks optimized away - we can now check with Patmos easily
\item Working on getting the license correct - issue with code from unknown source
\item Useful in general for embedded systems/barebone systems where less libraries are available
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\todo{A brief introduction what the paper is about. It shall include briefly the
main contributions and findings. The contributions can be bullet listed.}

This paper... \todo{purpose statement, latest in 4th paragraph}


The contributions of this paper are: (1) ... (2) ...

This paper is organized in N sections: The following section presents related work.
Section~\ref{sec:related} presents related work.
Section~\ref{sec:collect} presents the benchmark collection, its classification, and the updates
to make them useful.
Section~\ref{sec:eval} evaluates the benchmark collection on...
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\todo{Show that you know the field. All related work shall be put
into context or contrast to our current work.}

A paper is cited~\cite{wcet:bench:2012}.

General purpose benchmarking, with a focus on open source and embedded systems.

JemBench.

\section{The Benchmark Collection}
\label{sec:collect}


\subsection{Benchmark Sources}

\todo{what did we collect. How many indirections in collections have there be?
E.g., adpcm.c: (1) SOURCE : C Algorithms for Real-Time DSP by P. M. Embree,
(2) SNU-RT Benchmark Suite, (3) MDH, and (4) TACLeBench. How have
benchmarks  changed? Legal changes?}

\subsection{Classification}

\todo{Talk about kernel, medium size, and application benchmarks and their usage.}

\subsection{Issues with the Original Sources}


\todo{Show the issues with code snippets}

\begin{itemize}
\item Compiler optimization
\item byte order
\item low-level access to device registers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usage Recommandations}

\todo{Mmh shall we have this?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use a stable version. At the time of this writing we should have V 2.0
\item Do not edit the benchmarks
\item Use all benchmarks in your evaluation. Don't introduce a bias in your evaluation by
\emph{selecting the most representative benchmarks} for your improvement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Licenses}

\todo{What we have. The issue with getting the right ones.}

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

\todo{Computer engineering is a constructive science. We build stuff and we measure.
Therefore, there shall always be an evaluation section.}

Possible Options for the Evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compile for an embedded processor and measure execution time
\item Compile for Patmos and use pasim for execution cycles
\item Show how compiler optimizations optimized away the original code and how we fixed this
\item Complexity numbers with bar charts on execution time and maybe tools
\item Use some WCET tools
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\todo{Rephrase what this paper is about and list the main contributions and results.}

\subparagraph*{Acknowledgements}

\todo{TACLe COST action phrase}

We want to thank \dots for helping in restructuring the benchmarks.
We want to thank Bendikt Huber for porting the Lift benchmark from Java to C.

\todo{Ack Niclas for contributing DEBIE in open-source.}
