- Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
  line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
- Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by

- Two empty lines are put between any two functions
- In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
  one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
- In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
  each comma/colon
- For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
- Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
  whitespace
- Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
  separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
  "else"
- Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
  body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
  "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
- Function arguments are specified in ANSI style, i.e.,
    float my_sqrtf( float val )
  and NOT in Kernighan&Ritchie style like, e.g.,
    float my_sqrtf( val )
      float val;
