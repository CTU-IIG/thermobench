- Lines shall not be wider than 80 characters; whenever possible, appropriate
  line breaks shall be inserted to keep lines below 80 characters
- Indentation is done using whitespaces only, no tabs. Code is indented by
  two whitespaces
- Two empty lines are put between any two functions
- In non-empty lists or index expressions, opening '(' and '[' are followed by
  one whitespace, closing ')' and ']' are preceded by one whitespace
- In comma- or colon-separated argument lists, one whitespace is put after
  each comma/colon
- For pointer types, one whitespace is put before the '*'
- Operators within expressions shall be preceded and followed by one
  whitespace
- Code of then- and else-parts of if-then-else statements shall be put in
  separate lines, not in the same lines as the if-condition or the keyword
  "else"
- Opening braces '{' denoting the beginning of code for some if-else or loop
  body shall be put at the end of the same line where the keywords "if",
  "else", "for", "while" etc. occur
- Function arguments are specified in ANSI style, i.e.,
    float my_sqrtf( float val )
  and NOT in Kernighan&Ritchie style like, e.g.,
    float my_sqrtf( val )
      float val;
- Library code (e.g. from the math or C stdlib) shall be directly included in
  each benchmark's code base in the form of separate .c/.h files so that each
  benchmark is fully self-contained.
- Naming convention of benchmarks: Remove all obsolete type and size information
  as well as obsolete further specifications from the benchmark names. E.g.
    fft_1024_13 -> fft
    n_complex_updates_float  -> complex_updates
    basicmath_small -> basicmath
    fir2dim <- fir2dim_float
  Unify the names of encoder/decoder benchmarks to 'name_enc' or 'name_dec',
  resp.:
    h264_dec_ldecode_macroblock -> h264_dec
    gsm_decode -> gsm_dec
    adpcm_encoder -> adpcm_enc
  Directory and file names must not include capital letters.
- Remove 'static' declaration of global variables and functions completely, and
  add the benchmark name as prefix for these global symbols.
- Each benchmark is preceeded by a generic TACLeBench header briefly describing
  what the benchmark does, where it originally stems from, names of original
  authors (if existing) and eventually existing original license/copyright
  statements:
